# MyTherapy.Space
2021 Hackabull

NOTE: Our domain for the domain name challenge is mytherapy.space
We weren't able to register the domain because domain.com wasn't working. Stephen (from MLH) said in the help-desk discord channel that we could still complete in the challenge

## Inspiration
We took the idea from this harsh time during the pandemic. Many people are in need of mental and wellness support. We decided to build an application that can connect patients to their therapist and allow them to do daily wellness/mental health check-ins

## What it does
Our websites allow patients to submit daily check-ins/information to their therapist. The patient and therapist can then see the information submitted by the patient. The therapist will also be able to analyze the patient's data and provide tips/tricks/advice to said patient

## How we built it
We built it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, and Bootstrap

## Challenges we ran into
- Figuring out how to send data back and forth from the frontend to the backend was the hardest challenge that occurred because the frontend and backend used 2 completely different programming languages
- Getting the website to continuous update itself so the user interface was dynamic (when the person entered information, they could instantly see that data processed and displayed)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Getting the website to be dynamic
- Getting a fully functional UI for the patient dashboard

## What we learned
- Got better at using Flask (sessions, app.route, etc.)
- Learned how to store/send/receive information with Flask
- Graphing a graph

## What's next for MyTherapy.Space
- Build a better UI for the therapist dashboard
- Add customizable questions that the therapist can set
